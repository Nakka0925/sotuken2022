COMMENT     The DNA used in the Labrador assembly was derived from a male
            Labrador retriever. DNA long reads were generated by Novogene using
            a Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) Sequel instrument. Eighteen SMRT
            cells yielded 135 subreads (56.5x estimated raw coverage, N50
            average=19,332). The long read data were processed at The Roslin
            Institute (University of Edinburgh, UK). Contig level assembly was
            generated using Falcon-unzip capturing the 2.4 Gbp long genome in
            1,439 contigs (with contig N50 of 9Mbp). Scaffolding was done,
            first, using optical mapping data produced on a Bionano Saphyr
            instrument, University of Nottingham Deep Seq) using Bionano Solve
            software. This was followed by scaffolding based on proximity
            ligation method. The Hi-C library was created using Dovetail's Hi-C
            library preparation kit. Refining the scaffolds were done using
            Dovetail HiRise pipeline. Error correction was done using the
            PacBio long-read data with Racon, followed by polishing with Pilon
            using an Illumina short read library generated from the same dog.
            Gap filling was done using PBJelly with the PacBio long-read
            dataset.
            The mitochondrial (MT) sequence was assembled from filtered, MT
            specific, PacBio long-read data using the Flye assembler and was
            error corrected with Illumina short-read data with Pilon.
